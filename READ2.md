# Text Editor:
I was read  a paragraph about a programmer problem about text editor 
the problem is When I first started out learning about web development, one of the
things that I felt compelled to do was to download a text editor. I
figured that I was going to be writing a good deal of code, and a good
text editor should help me do that

## WHat Is the Text Editor ?

### A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer 



## I think you’ll find that when using the text editors that come on your
computer, that there are no special bells or whistles at all. I think
you’ll find that there is no code completion. But what that means is
your text editor won’t assist you in finding your mistakes. You’ll have
to discover them on your own.
I think you’ll find that there is no syntax highlighting, no themes and
no extensions. While you most certainly can use them to make a
website, I think the real question is, “Should you?” They’re not the
most feature rich text editors available.
