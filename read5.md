How to specify colors 
Color terminology and contrast
Background color 

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.
 To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
understanding Color
Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels 
(if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).
When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light.
 When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.
The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue â€” just like on a television screen.
Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. 
You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.
The hex value is provided next to the pound or hash # symbol. There is also a good color picking tool at:

RGB Values
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. 
rgb(102,205,170)
This color is made up of the following values: 102 red 205 green 170 blue
Hex Codes
Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
#66cdaa
The value of the red, 102, is expressed as 66 in hexadecimal code.
 The 205 of the green is expressed as cd and the 170 of the blue equates to aa.
ColoR Names
Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.

Hue
Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color.
 Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.

Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color.
 At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.

Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color.
 At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. 
At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.


Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps 
 convey the mood and evokes reactions.
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
 RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
 between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to 
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, 
 with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
