the Site For :
Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
Invent some fictional visitors from your typical
target audience. They will become your friends.
They can influence design decisions from color
palettes to level of detail in descriptions.

 Why People Visit
YOUR Website ?
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.

What Information
Your Visitors Need ?

You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively.

Site Maps :
Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.

Summary
PROCESS & Design of Chapter 18 :
It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.


Chapter 17 HTML5 Layout :
HTML5 layout elements.
How old browsers understand new elements.
Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS.

HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.

Traditional HTML
Layouts:
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

New Html 5 Layout
El ements :

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.
Summary of Chapter 17 HTML5 Layout:

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
