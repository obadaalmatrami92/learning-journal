Git : Version control System

Git is a distributed revision control system available on all mainstream development platforms through a free software license. An important difference of git over its older ancestors is that it elevates the software's revisions to first-class citizens. Developers care deeply about software revisions, and git supports this by giving each developer a complete private copy of the software repository and numerous ways to manage revisions within its context. The ability to associate a local repository with numerous remote ones allows developers and their managers to build a variety of interesting distributed workflows, most of which are impossible to run on a traditional centralized version control system. The local repository also makes git responsive, easy to setup, and able to operate without Internet connectivity. GitHub is a git repository hosting provider that simplifies many repository management tasks through a Web-based user interface while also promoting cooperation in open source projects. 
History of Git
Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.
for example Git compatabile with MaC OS X, Windows and Linux.
