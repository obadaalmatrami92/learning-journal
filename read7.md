how do computers work ?

we can now learn how computer really works,information is representesd using elecricity
 the for main parts of a computer 
1) Input 
2) storage
3) cpu
4) output 
we discover that the software controls hardware , the first version of computer was very slow and it can`t do a lot of tasks like now 
now the computer super fast it can do a handred of tasks at the same time.

now we can know the input Devices like Keyboard, output Devices like screen.

computers work on ones & zeroes , almost nobody deals directly with ones & Zeroes.
do play a big role in.
wiers & circuits
carry all the infornation in a computer 
how do you store or represent information using electricity?
the single cloud either be on or off ,or 0 , 1 . true or false 

Bit is the smallest piece of information a computer store , with more bits you can represent more complex information 

the binary number system:
decimal 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, 
binary 0 1 ,
any number can represent with binary system,
we can represent text, images, video and sound. 
the computer use circule and half adder and full adder 
and use logic gates like AND,OR,Xor and Not, the computer do subtraction and multiplication.
 As we all know the computer work with hardware & software.

computing device:
hardware: circuts,chips,wires,speakers,plugs and stuff.
software : apps ,games,websites,creative.

hardware & software : Central proccessing unit.
Cpu master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer it do math & logic ,Send & receive.

the cpu receives simple commands that tell it which circut to use.
cpu can do every processes of the computer.
